# Tooling

## Task 2
**2.1**

### IDE:
Feature|Visual Studio Code | PyCharm|
|---|------------ | -------------|
|price|is a Microsoft editor that is entirely free and open-source.|The free community edition is the only one available; the professional edition costs about $200 per year.|
|Git Integration|You can utilize git integration in Vscode by creating a git repo on the GitHub UI and then cloning it from the terminal.|You may use PyCharm's git integration to create a local git repo in your project folder and in the GitHub UI.|
|Code Completion|Code completion that is intelligent|Code completion that is intelligent|
|Debugging|have tools for debugging and code inspection|have tools for debugging and code inspection|
|Performance|requires less memory and consumes RAM in MBs.|takes up about 1 GB of memory|
|Ease of use|Anything may be searched for and will appear in the results.|It's a little difficult to figure out where to look for the setting choices.|
|Cross Platform Compatibility|Windows, Mac OSX and Linux|Windows, Mac OSX and Linux|


### Operating System

Feature|Windows | Linux|
|---|------------ | -------------|
|price|commercial operating system that you must purchase in order to use it|open source software that is free to use.|
|Update speed|The troubleshooting process is sluggish and time-consuming.|Any defect or bug may be quickly discovered, reported, and resolved.|
|Security|Less secure security|it is more secure|
|Speed of operation|slower than average, and getting slower with time|quicker and more effective|
|Programmer friendliness|Do not provide linux-like features.|It works with all major programming languages.|


### Version-control platform
Feature|GitHub | GitLab|
|---|------------ | -------------|
|Free plans|GitHub projects are free and available to the public, but only for public repositories |GitLab is a code repository where only its team of web developers may participate. There are no limits on the number of public and private repositories that may be created.|
|Paid plans|Starts at `$84` per user per year|Starts at `$39` per user per year|
|Location|In the free plan, GitHub does not enable you to locate a repository within an organization.|The free plan allows you to locate a repository inside an organization.|
|Issue Tracker|allows pulling requests to be made so that the issues raised are immediately closed when the repository is merged.|allows users to link problems to PRs so that they can be closed automatically.|
|Documentation|divided into a number of different manuals, each of which focuses on a different platform.|similar to language documentation with a search bar, displaying all of the installer's needed papers|
|Integration|In GitHub, there is no built-in continuous integration. Third-party suppliers are in charge of providing it.|GitLab has a built-in integration system. They prefer to use their own integration tools, which are constantly updated.|
|Authentication|Authenticating who has access to the repository and who does not can be done based on their job.|A developer has the power to decide whether or not a repository should be accessed.|
|Community|GitHub is home to a sizable developer community. It has millions of active users with whom to debate issues.|GitLab organizes community events that bring together contributors and open-source projects.|
|Platform|It has a development platform where projects are stored. It has features like task management, bug tracking, and so on.|provides web-based DevOps internal repository management.|
|Inner sourcing|allows for the promotion of internal repository inner sourcing.|doesn't permit internal sourcing.|
|Confidential Issues|This module produces confidential issues that are only available to project participants.|It lacks the characteristic of a confidential problem.|

### As In IDE I have chosen VS Code :

*Performance:VS Code easily outperforms PyCharm in terms of performance.Because VS Code doesn't pretend to be an IDE and instead focuses on being a text editor, it has a considerably smaller memory footprint, start-up time, and general responsiveness than PyCharm.Extensibility: VS Code, on the other hand, is meant to be a basic editor that can be expanded into a full-fledged IDE with the help of extensions.A single addon provides complete java script functionality(including syntax highlighting, debugging, and code completion).VS Code offers extensions for nearly everything, and developers may easily create their own. The VS Code Marketplace has all these extensions. As a result, =VS Code is considerably more expandable than PyCharm.*

*VSCode is an open-source program that you may use for free. It includes extensions and plugins that enhance the editor's capabilities. It also comes with a variety of pre-installed color-coded themes. It works with Git repositories like GitHub and Bitbucket. Also, VSCode is a lightweight editor with an incredibly snappy user interface that allows you to work on several files at once.*

### As an Operating System I have chosen Linux:
*Linux is open-source software that is free to use. Any problem or bug may be quickly discovered, reported, and resolved. When it comes to the security of your data or in the event of a hostile internet threat, Linux tends to be more secure than Windows. Intruders find it difficult to penetrate Linux's security apparatus thanks to the engineers who use and work with it. Encryption is the simplest technique to secure personal data against unauthorized access. During installation, Linux Mint or Ubuntu allow you to encrypt the entire hard drive or only the home directory. Linux is also more efficient and quicker. It performs instructions rapidly and has a short run-time. This is owing to its small size and intelligent performance parameter control. For programmers and web developers, Linux delivers a more friendly and appealing interface. All of the major programming languages are supported. Its features, including as a package management, bash scripting, SSH support, and apt commands, are extremely beneficial to programmers.*

### As a Version-control platform I have chosen GitHub:
*GitHub is one of the first cloud-based Git systems, allowing developers to host and track changes to their code. It's also grown into a full-fledged development platform. Also available are GitHub web-based repositories, which aid in code management and the exchange of local file changes with a remote repository. Because the files on the internet change often, all of the data is saved in a repository and may be accessed at any time. GitHub is required for Git development in order to track changes in source code. GitHub has a greater availability and is more focused on infrastructure performance, so it's a better option if you're working on a huge project with a lot of people.*
