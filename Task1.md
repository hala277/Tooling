# Task 1
## 1.1

## The problem:
*user find it hard to not have a favorite list and a website that doesn't have ads when he enters to see a movie or a series so the client asks us to make a website that didnâ€™t have ads and have a fav list so can the user watch his fav shows and add them to his list without any problem.*
 
## How we solved the problem and what we add:
 
1. *The client asks for the main page that contains two slide shows one for the movies and the other for the series and to be above each other in the main section in the middle and have two buttons to switch to the move page or the series page.* 

2. *The client also asks to add a slide show at the top of the movies, series page, and in the main section ask to add the moves or the series in a line contain four moves or series in each.*

3. *The client asks to add an animation to the moves or series pic so when the user puts the mouse on it, it will flip the pic and show the rating and info about the show.*

4. *The client asks to add another page when clicking on the show, that page must contain the move or series pic on the top, left side, and on the right add the pic information about the movie or the series like the story or the rating, duration of the show and so, under these, the client wants to add the trailer.*

5. *the client wants to add the connection links at the bottom of the page so when the user clicks on them it will move them to the social media page also he asks to add the logo there so on each page e have a logo in the header and the bottom.*

6. *the most important thing to solve the main problem that adds a list so the user can add his favorite show there, the list will be showing under the show so if the user wants to add anything he should click on the button that is found beside the move or the series page.*

7. *clint want to add shopping card so the user can add his movies or series and buy them. and creat form to add user information so when he buy the movies he will need to fill the form.*

## 1.2
## Risk:
1. *The scope of work is not well defined. The danger here is that will overlook critical details or make a mistake while defining the scope of work.*
2. *Adding non-essential features.*
3. *Take extra time to master a new programming language, piece of software, or hardware component, or have a team study it together.*
4. *Improper planning.*
5. *More funds are required.*
6. *updates and corrections at the final minute*
7. *problem in local storige*
8. *problem with server*
9. *have conflict and couldn't solve it*

## 1.3 
+ List of requirements :
*I did mention them at 1.1*

+ Database design and the wireframe:

### wireframe

![main img](/img/mainPage.jpeg)
![every show img](/img/everyShowPage1.jpeg)
![show page img](/img/showPage.jpeg)
![show img](/img/aboutUsPage.jpeg)
![cartPage](/img/cartPage.jpeg)

------------------------------

+ Database design:

*we have used local storage to store our data ,**array of object** in:*

+ movie name
+ movie img
+ movie link
+ add to cart
+ form data

*The data type for all of object will be converted to string so we can store them in our local storage and then we will use them to add to favorite lost.*
---------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Activity Diagram:

![Activity Diagram](/img/ActivityDiagram2.jpeg)

*The user can first start from home page and go to movies/series/about us pages and from movies/series he can go to show page and he can come back from there to the home page or to movies/series ,but in the about us page he can just go from this page to home page .*

+ Coding and implementation technique:

*we will use agile becuse Agile project management is an iterative method to software development project management that emphasizes continuous releases and client input at each iteration.Agile project management techniques help software teams speed up development, enhance communication, and improve their capacity to adapt to market changes.*

## the technique:
**Scrum** *is a methodology for addressing complex adaptive issues while producing and delivering high-value solutions in a productive and creative manner.*

### How does it work?
1. *A Product Owner creates a Product Backlog to organize the work for a complicated challenge.*
2. *During a Sprint, the team converts a portion of the work into a value increment.*
3. *The Team and its stakeholders review the findings and make necessary adjustments for the next Sprint.*
4. *Repeat*

+ 	Testing technique
### we will use balck box testing:

**Black Box Testing** *is a software testing approach that involves testing the functionality of software applications without knowing the internal code structure, implementation details, or internal pathways. Black Box Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the input and output of software applications and is fully driven by software requirements and specifications. It's also known as Behavioral psychology.*

## How will we do BlackBox testing?
1. First, the system's needs and specifications are evaluated.
2. The tester selects legitimate inputs (a positive test scenario) to determine if the SUT successfully processes them. In addition, certain incorrect inputs are generated (negative test scenario) to ensure that the SUT can detect them.
3. Tester calculates the anticipated outcomes for each of the inputs.
4. With the specified inputs, the software tester creates test cases.
5. The test cases are carried out.
6. The actual outputs are compared to the predicted outputs by the software tester.
7. Any defects are repaired and retested.
